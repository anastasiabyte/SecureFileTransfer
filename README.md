Secure File Store
===============================================
This is a project I worked on for my Computer Security course in Spring of 2018. It was designed to reinforce security skills related to confidentiality and integrity. Through a series of functions, I used a public key structure to upload/download files securely to an insecure server.

All original code is contained in client.py and this was a collaborative project with a fellow student. Original project instructions are included below.
